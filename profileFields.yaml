# Profile fields configuration
# Each field should have an 'id' (used in code) and a 'label' (displayed to users)

# !! Note: the code cannot currently handle modifying (adding/removing field entries) this file as it will cause profiles that have previously been stored in browser data to be out of sync with the 
# new/removed/editted fields in the newer file. To work around this you can delete all profiles and re-add them after modifying the file below. 
# editting exiting entries (for example adding/removing aliases or common_labels) is fine
